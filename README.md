# Abnormal accounts

## Description
Here we have a black list from some abnormal accounts in twitter.


We cannot gaurauntee tha all accounts are robots but we gaurauntee they use twitter in very strange way

## SUSPECTS
### Important point
The accounts in the suspects are just the accounts. we detect their strange behavior. 


You can find the suspects ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricks135/Abnormally-twitter/main/suspects/suspects.md) | [csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricks135/Abnormally-twitter/main/suspects/suspects.csv))


### Warining
- Maybe some accounts wrongly placed in this list. An algorithm review them surely it has some error
- We list them in the url by their permanent link in twitter so they cannot change the link
- Many of these accounts act like people but they spread false news
- Currently we focus on accounts that act like normal people but they are not so maybe you do not find them (ARZESHI)

## ARZESHI
The accounts in the arzeshi are just the accounts. they are ARZESHI accounts and most of them (more than 70%) have strange behavior.


You can find the ARZESHI in the below.

## Important note
- In `arzeshi_0004.csv` in despite of other batches only 19% of them are bots which is very low. So this file could use to detect core network of arzeshies.


## UPDATES
- 12k new ARZESHI accounts added (9k bots between them)

## Upcoming
- New arzehsi bots
